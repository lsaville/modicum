8/24/17 I'm imagining currently a tick-back and tick-forward button. It might
be as good as the spacebar trick, but going backward and forward avoiding the 
potential infinite loop (although my half-hearted attempt at that truly was 
half-hearted. I neglected to realize that the time of the pause is naturally
much greater than the duration of play). As the minimal minimal thing I could
do to improve the whole thing, the user could drop the url in the page and it
becomes a one-time study session (without the backing of db/server/etc). That
could be a nice first step to keep things interesting and actually use the 
thing while gumption is found to continue its development. I also thought
tonight that it'd be swell to have a display for a move (let it have a title?)
and that there could be a visualization of where the moves lay in the video.
Red tick marks along a bar representing the length? What is the smallest unit 
of time I'd deal with? 1.4040258836517334 is one of the captured times. (no 
wonder I broke the browser running that impromptu stopGo). It suggests that I'd
need to discover what the smallest perceptual chunk of time is. I was just 
wondering if you could use that bar to map the user chosen moves of a given 
video. I've been enjoying how everytime I come back to this I run of on another
'possibilites' tangent.
